    "security": {
      "description": "The application should protect user data and prevent unauthorized access",
      "sub_requirements": [
        "1.1: Validate user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks",
        "1.2: Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Technical Constraints**

```json
{
  "technical_constraints": {
    "api_dependencies": {
      "description": "The application relies on the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data",
      "sub_requirements": [
        "1.1: Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data",
        "1.2: Handle API rate limits and errors"
      ]
    },
    "database_requirements": {
      "description": "The application does not require a database for storing weather data",
      "sub_requirements": [
        "1.1: Use caching to store weather data for a reasonable amount of time"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
